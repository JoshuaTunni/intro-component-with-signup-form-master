Tips from feedback:
- limit mixins, avoid premature abstraction
- ^ use placeholders
- use breakpoint mixins rather than media queries
  @mixin for-phone-only {
    @media (max-width: 599px) { 
      @content; 
    }
  }
- remove unneeded variables:
  single use var
  mixins doing something a single property can do (padding-block for vert!)
- avoid commenting obvious code

Tips from sitepoint:
- functions for calc
- break things up in more files;
  |-  _components
    |-  _button
    |- _carousel
    |- _etc.
- K.I.S.S - before adding mixins or other sass stuff, make sure it will enhavce developemnt not overcomplicate it
  unecessary list of variables without clear usage
  unclear functions or mixins etc.


File/folder architecture:
- utility = var, func, mixin, placeholders
- base = reset/normalize, global settings, typography
- components = unique classes 
- layout = breakpoints
