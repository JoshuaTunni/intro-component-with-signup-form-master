  am i abstracting files too much? 
    should article, form and panel be separate this way?
  = i think so yes, form is a component whilst the article is a part of the layout of the page
    the question i should now ask is should panel be a thing or done nested under article?
    = yes, a component doesnt have to be interactive only a unique thing that isnt a part of a layout!

  im trying to get form validation to work, currently using data attributes to js hook and begin validating conditions

13/04/22
  i have gotten first, sec and email validating, struggling with password conditions;
    removing all condition bar uppercase letters, seems to work use this as a base

  all form validation is working! good job :D
  now im getting styling done

  form vs article {nest} what am i supposed to do?
    is the form a component or a layout?
      if so, then shouldnt promo also be a component? not nested in card and if so, card has nothing -__-

  utils = understood
  base:
    global = set everything before extra specificity; its okay to override stuff with classes here (20 things hit, 3 things overriding is better than going through all with a class :/)
    reset = understood
    typography = global but for content-text specific stuff
  component = anything, does one thing only, re-usable and independent
  layout = largest components - footer, header, main, article; the wireframe of the page

  (b)
    biggest struggle is understanding the separation of things 
    -if i make some form, input and btn components, they all require their own sub-compoent partial, 
    -some extra naming to separate other similar components; 3 btns are different to one and other
    -whereas i could nest these in a form class -_- 


  Components:
  1) Parent / Free 
  2) Child
  3) Modifier

  ive created a better system of nesting and class naming
  the goal now is to rethink base stuff, variables and resets are acceptable 
    but global and typography feel off; if its unclear what tag a design is
    then dont do it but the design might change
    in a real world thus needing both html and css to be changed, 
    feels like i should just use classes 
      do i ref the same classes in multiple places? typography hooks class-a, component/card hooks class-a too but 
      doesnt do anthing to do with typography(font, col, letter, line, alignment, bkgd col)
    is layout pointless now -> i feel so yes, components are king so
      utils/breakpoints, func, vars, placeholders, mixins
      base/reset, typography 
      components/component#, ...

  everything is a component. 
  allow components to space themselves as they "are"
  spaces between is for containers if equal

  BEM + SASS + SMACSS + OOCSS
  
  utils - variables, placeholders, mixins, func
  base - tags, resets, typography
  layout:
    wireframe of site...
    header, footer, main, aside, article, section, nav - others such as banner or ads etc.
    containers / wrappers go here (theyre not components!)
  module - BEM structures, use placeholders + extend + mixins (OOCSS)
  state - is-name class js hooks
